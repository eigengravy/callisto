# Callisto

Callisto is a knowledge platform that enables users to learn by actively answering questions.
Questions and answers are generated from content sourced from websites, articles and documents which helps users in gauging their level of understanding in a particular topic.  

Prototype made for the Dhishna Make-A-Ton 2019 hosted by CUSAT.
